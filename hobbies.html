            Do problem solving on <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/ayush_udy">Coding platforms</a>
            <br>
            <p>I love the problem solving and always taking small challenges in order to <strong>learn something new</strong>. Every problem teaches something new.
            I reallly like that aspect of the competative coding and those coding challenges make it a bit more competative</p>

        <li><a href="Morning_walk.html">NATURE OBSERVATION</a>
            <br>
            <p>I like to observe different species of plants and animals. I have observed many birds,insects, plants and some other animals.</p>
            <p>The morning time is the best time to see all of them as at that time all birds are most active they area flying and chirping everywhere.
                Here at the college I have seen them mostly in the morning around the lake area as that region is most silent in the morning.
                At that time one can easily hear the different sounds present around. The loud chirping of the Maynas, the littile sparrows playing around, the 
                peigons usual squawk, the complementing breezes and the rustling leaves are and added joy.
